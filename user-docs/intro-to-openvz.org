* About this Document
This document provides the basic information about virtualization and OpenVZ - a server virtualization software for linux-based computers.\\

*Audience of this Document*\\
The primary audience of this document are the Integration Engineers who are involved in the Auto-Deployment process. It is assumed that the Integration Engineers are comfortable with Linux system administration.\\

*System Pre-requsites*\\
The hardware and software requirements of the systems that the Integration Engineers use for virtualization are:\\
+ Minimum 2GB RAM
+ The machine should have one dedicated partition for CentOS (version 6.5 only)
+ Minimum 50GB hard disk space
+ The machine should have a dual core processor

*Assumptions*\\
It is assumed that the Integration Engineers will have the lab sources of their respective Institutes with them.

* Introduction to Virtualization

+ Virtualization is a framework or methodology of dividing the resources of a computer into multiple execution environments. Virtualization techniques create multiple isolated partitions such as Virtual Machines (VM) or Virtual Environments (VEs) on a single physical server. 
+ Virtualization refers to the abstraction of computer resources. It is "a technique for hiding the physical characteristics of computing resources from the way in which other systems, applications, or end users interact with those resources. This involves making a single physical resource (such as a server, an operating system, an application, or storage device) function as multiple logical resources; or it can involve making multiple physical resources (such as storage devices or servers) appear as a single logical resource."
+ The common theme of all virtualization technologies is the hiding of technical detail through encapsulation. Virtualization creates an external interface that hides an underlying implementation by multiplexing access, by combining resources at different physical locations, or by simplifying a control system.

* Types of Virtualization

1. *Full virtualization*: This involves almost complete simulation of the actual hardware to allow software of a guest operating system to run unmodified.
2. *Partial virtualization*: In this scenario, some but not all the target environment is simulated. Some guest programs may need modifications to run in this virtual environment.
3. *Paravirtualization*: In this environment, a hardware environment is not simulated. However, the guest programs are executed in their own isolated domains as if they are running on a separate system. Guest programs need to be specifically modified to run in this environment.

* Operating System-level Virtualization

+ Operating system-level virtualization is a server virtualization method where the kernel of an operating system allows multiple isolated user space instances instead of just one. Such instances often called containers, virtualization engines (VE), virtual private servers (VPS) or FreeBSD jail(jails) may look and feel like a real server from the point of view of its owners and users. On Unix-like operating systems, this technology can be seen as an advanced implementation of the standard chroot mechanism. In addition to isolation mechanisms, the kernel often provides resource management features to limit the impact of one container's activities on the other containers. Virtual labs architecture uses OS level virtualization software called OpenVZ.

* Introduction to OpenVZ

+ OpenVZ is container-based virtualization for Linux. OpenVZ creates multiple secure, isolated Linux containers (otherwise known as VEs or VPSs) on a single physical server enabling better server utilization and ensuring that applications do not conflict.
+ Each container performs and executes exactly like a stand-alone server; a container can be rebooted independently and have root access, users, IP addresses, memory, processes, files, applications, system libraries and configuration files.
 
** What is a Container?

+ A container (otherwise known as CT, Virtual Environment (VE), Virtual Private Server (VPS) etc.) is one of the main concepts of OpenVZ.
+ Container is an isolated entity which performs and executes exactly like a stand-alone server. Container can be rebooted independently and have root access, users/groups, IP address(es), memory, processes, files, applications, system libraries and configuration files.
+ OpenVZ supports multiple CTs (as many as several hundreds) on a single Hardware Node. 

** What is an OpenVZ kernel?

*The OpenVZ kernel is a Linux kernel modified to support OpenVZ containers. It has the following functionalities:*
*** Virtualization and Isolation
*This is a functiionaliy where each container is a separate entity, and behaves like a physical server. Each container has its own:*
***** Files
    System libraaries, applications, virtualized /proc and /sys, virtualized locks, etc.

***** Users and groups
    Each container has its own root user as well as other users and groups.

***** Process tree
    A container only sees its own processes (starting from init). PIDs are virtualized, so that the init PID is 1 as it should be.

***** Network
    A virtual network device, which allows a container to have its own IP addresses as well as a set of netfilter (iptables), and routing rules.

***** Devices
    If needed, any container can be granted access to real devices like network interfaces, serial ports, disk partitions, etc.

***** IPC objects
    Shared memory, semaphores, messages. 
*** Enables many VEs within a single kernel
According to this functionality, many containers can be created on top of a single OpenVZ kernel. 
*** Resource management
*As per this functionality, the OpenVZ kernel manages CPU, RAM, Disk space on a per VE basis*
*- OpenVZ resource management is a set of controls providing per-container resource accounting and limiting.*\\ 
*- This is required for multiple containers to coexist gracefully on a single host system.*\\
*- OpenVZ resource management includes these four primary controllers:*\\
+ User beancounters (and VSwap)
+ Disk quota
+ CPU Fair scheduler
+ I/O priorities and I/O limits
*** Checkpointing
+ This functionality involves freezing a VE, saving its state to disk with the ability to unfreeze the state later.

* OpenVZ Installation
 The following link briefly describes the steps needed to install OpenVZ on a CentOS 6 machine.
